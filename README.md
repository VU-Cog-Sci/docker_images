# docker_images
repo for docker scripts and images in the lab

This repo contains shell scripts using the neurodocker interface, and the latest `Dockerfile` outputs. These docker images allow us to synchronize the processing platform across the lab.

This repo documents the evolution of the shared software tools of the Knapen lab. 


## For creating Dockerfile: see neurodocker.sh
